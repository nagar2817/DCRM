# CRM with Django

This is a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) application built using Django framework, which allows businesses to manage their interactions with customers and streamline their sales processes. The app provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, allowing users to :

- Create new customers and store their contact information
- View a list of all customers in the system
- Update the details of existing customers
- Delete customers from the system
The app is designed to be easy to use and customizable, with a simple interface and clean code structure. It uses Django's built-in authentication system to allow users to log in and manage customer data securely.
